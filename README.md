# AamMeshPS
This is test used as part of the application process for Infrastructure Engineers at AAM. The challenge is to fix this partially completed PowerShell module so that all Pester tests pass, you will find various syntax issues and tests missing their code implementation.

## Pester Tests
Pester tests are created and placed in the test folder. Running the command below from the root of the AamMeshPS repo will run all of the Pester tests in the Test repo.

```
Invoke-PSake .\build.psake.ps1 -taskList Test
```

[Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester/wiki) is written in PowerShell and uses a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) syntax that should be familiar to those experienced within other languages too.
